# Please Keep Documentation Up to Date!
When adding or updating a schema, please put appropriate descriptions or documentation in these folders. 
A well documented readme file with descriptions of tables is sufficient.  If data are from an outside source, please download and include -- or link to -- the outside documentation as well.
