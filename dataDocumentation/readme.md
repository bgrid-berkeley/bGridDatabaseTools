# Please Keep Documentation Up to Date!
When adding or updating a schema, please put appropriate descriptions or documentation in these folders. 
A well documented readme file with descriptions of tables is sufficient.  If data are from an outside source, please download and include -- or link to -- the outside documentation as well. 

## scratch schemas
Feel free to set up a "scratch" schema with your username as the schemaname. You don't have to document it here though, it's probably better practice not to broadcast all usernames over github.
